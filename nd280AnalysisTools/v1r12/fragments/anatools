# -*- makefile -*-
#
# A fragment used by CMT to build the nd280AnalysisTools. This is based
# on the external fragment used to compile packages like ROOT and CLHEP.
#
# This version is different though, as much more functionality happens
# in the header script than the main script. This is because the main
# script is only invoked if CMT thinks there have been changes to the 
# code, and it seems to only look in the src directory. The header
# functions are always invoked, so we call our compile script from
# there and do the checking ourselves in runAnalyses.py.
#
# Usage in the requirements file is:
#    "document anatools <package> <compile script>"
