Still incomplete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful files:

datafiles_used.txt   :  List of data run/subruns that were used and number of POT associated to it
NumuCutsDefinition.h :  Definitions of cuts apply to the analysis
NumuGeomDefinition.h :  Definition of the geometry for the fiducial volume.
NumuDataFiles.h      :  example of how to load the chained NumuFlatTree

Macros:
McEffPur.C           : Example of how to compute efficiency and purity
		       (need some of the tools present Analysis_FlatTree/Tools)

That's it for now, need to be completed, done correclty for Global Analysis 10b.
